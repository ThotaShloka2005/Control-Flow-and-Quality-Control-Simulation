This project simulates control flow mechanisms and quality control processes within a manufacturing or production environment. The simulation aims to model how control decisions impact product quality, process efficiency, and overall system performance.
Features
Process Flow Modeling: Simulate the sequence of operations in a production line.

Quality Control Checks: Implement checkpoints to inspect product quality at various stages.

Defect Detection and Handling: Identify defective items and apply corrective measures.

Statistical Analysis: Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as defect rates, throughput, and downtime.

Scenario Testing: Experiment with different control strategies and quality thresholds.

Real-time Feedback: Observe how changes in process parameters affect quality outcomes

Installation
